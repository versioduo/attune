 ðŸŽ¹ Voltek Labs â€“ Piano-1

Piano-1 is an automated upright acoustic piano, consisting of an electronic key-pressing mechanism mounted to a
sliding carriage, attached to a rail spanning the width of the keyboard. It plays one note at a time, with the
duration between events informed by how fast it moves, and how far it has to travel.
